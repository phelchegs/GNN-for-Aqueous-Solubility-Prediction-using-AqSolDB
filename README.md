# GNN-for-Aqueous-Solubility-Prediction-using-AqSolDB
A graph neural network based on torch geometric for aqueous solubility prediction
* Predict aqueous solubility of organic molecules using graph neural network, i.e., node (atom), edge (bond), and stacking layers, instead of chem descriptors.
* Descriptors have been presented in the repo aqueous solubility prediction.
